  myDescription: [
    `We are Devika and Shreya, second-year Master of Computer Applications (MCA) students at Indira Gandhi Delhi 
  Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), united by our enthusiasm for technology, design, and solving real-world 
  problems. Our academic journey so far has helped us develop strong skills in programming, web development, and 
  logical thinking, while encouraging us to explore creative ways of building impactful solutions.
  
  This Portfolio Maker project is part of an exciting MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) internship 
  opportunity that has allowed us to learn by doing. Through this internship, we are gaining practical, hands-on 
  experience in full-stack development — from setting up back-end APIs to designing intuitive, responsive front-end 
  interfaces. It’s not just about coding, but also about understanding user needs and delivering something meaningful.
